Created models on how Wage is related to Education &amp; Work Experience.


Created models on how Wage is related to Education & Work Experience. Then created 2 two-sided t-tests on each variable in their respective SLR models. Then added the 9 occupation groups to the model because different occupations get paid different incomes along with different requirements of levels of education and experience. After this, I conducted more data analysis and created different restricted and unrestricted models to conduct 2 f-tests on each primary model and then created visualizations. Data retrieved from "Exam_data5_port".
